R3vised Standard Country Club website

This is a project that I am creating for my project portfolio to potentially present to Standard Country Club in hopes that they might use it.  

If in the event you would like to contribute to the project, just know that I am a developing novice.  As I progress through the code louisville program I will add more rich features to the site.

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to growing in the developer world.
